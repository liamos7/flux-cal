These were generated after there was some concern about if the WCS was off (i.e. such that the rotation was off, or some Jacobian issue). The purpose of these plots was hence to see if distance between objects would increase as if there was some rotation. The catalogs that generated these used a higher "distance-between-candidate-objects" thresholds, and hence are too large to be uploaded. I do not believe that there was any WCS issue.
